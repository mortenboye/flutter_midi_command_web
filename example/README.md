# flutter_midi_command_web_example

Demonstrates how to use the flutter_midi_command_web plugin.

## Getting Started

This example is intended to work with an Akai Fire midi-controller, but incoming midi events should be displayed for any midi controller, while the demonstration of sending midi data is Fire specific.

Note: currently there is a bug with displaying the listview of available midi devices on app start, so you need to do a hot-reload in order to get the listview items ui to appear.
